# title
A-O-K
# project overview
These lyrics are part of the walk up song of professional baseball player Bryson Stott who
famously hits a homerun right after the crowd sung along to A-O-K, his walk up song 
during a playoff game that was televised during that moment with just the stadium noise and
without the play-by-play announcers. Having all the fans in the stadium sing together 
is an example of the togetherness that is in community.
# technical overview
I will use the literally meaning of words and the animations will represent those meanings. 
I use the color yellow to indicate that the word is clickable.  This will be made using HTML
and CSS and hosted on GitHub.
