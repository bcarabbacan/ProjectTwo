# title
A-O-K
# project overview
These lyrics are part of the walk up song of professional baseball player Bryson Stott who
 famously hits a homerun right after the crowd sung along to A-O-K, his walk up song 
 during a playoff game that was televised during that moment with just the stadium noise and
without the play-by-play announcers. Having all the fans in the stadium sing together 
is an example of the togetherness that is in community.
# technical overview
I will use the literally meaning of words and the animations will represent those meanings. 
Lyrics that mention "blue" will have their text blue. Lyrics that mention "lemonade" will 
have their text yellow. I will also create shapes that represent the lyrics. "World" and 
its surrounding lyrics will be in the shape of a circle. Up will cause an animation of the 
text moving up. This will be made using HTML and CSS and hosted on GitHub.
